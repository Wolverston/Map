# Map

Project, made as a hometask for IT-School Hillel.

No make-up, just for javascript training.

We have a map and an input for new labels. After printing text in input and clicking button "Add" we have to click on a map to make a label with text.
Labels can be deleted or marked as favourite. 
All changes saved in local storage, so will be reloaded after page refresh.
